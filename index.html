                    <p>I woke up this morning just to realized i had spent the better part of my 6 months trusting the one person I never should have met. It started like a beautiful bliss that was honey combed in eyes of all that cared to notice and many did notice. She was my Bambi, my pure delight and the only reason I can even go hiking. With her it was like i was life surfing but i should have known better cos it was indeed too perfect to have true essence in reality. I was always the play boy and i had sworn to be true, to never give in to the emotions of true love and all its entangling packages, in short I was a User. I should have known because it always seemed like i was restrained to resources. She changed my insane Obsession and she became my obsession. This is my conversation with my dairy, a lonely heart shattered in Nano-bits. </p>
